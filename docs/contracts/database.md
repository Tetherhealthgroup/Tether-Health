# Database contract v1

Migration source of truth: `supabase/migrations/202609110001_profiles.sql`.

`public.profiles` is a one-to-one extension of `auth.users`; `id` is both its
primary key and cascading foreign key. A signup trigger creates the row. Clients
cannot choose another user's identity: RLS predicates use `auth.uid()`.

| Column | Contract |
|---|---|
| `id` | UUID, immutable identity, references `auth.users(id)` |
| `display_name` | nullable trimmed text, 1–80 characters when present |
| `locale` | `en` or `es` |
| `time_zone` | non-empty time-zone identifier, max 64 characters |
| `onboarding_completed` | boolean, defaults false |
| `avatar_path` | nullable private path under `<user-id>/`, max 512 characters |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | UTC timestamps; database managed |

Authenticated users may select and update only their row. Insert is performed by
the trusted signup trigger; direct delete is not granted. The controlled
`delete_my_app_data('DELETE')` security-definer function derives the caller from
`auth.uid()`, deletes only that profile and its cascading quit plan, and returns
row counts. Avatar objects use a private
bucket and must live under a folder matching `auth.uid()`.

## Quit-plan snapshot

Migration sources of truth:
`supabase/migrations/202609150001_quit_plans.sql`,
`supabase/migrations/202609150002_quit_plan_validator_grant.sql`,
`supabase/migrations/202609150003_quit_plan_upsert_grant.sql`,
`supabase/migrations/202609150004_quit_plan_integrity.sql`, and
`supabase/migrations/202609150005_quit_plan_contract_hardening.sql`.

`public.quit_plans` stores one complete plan snapshot per authenticated user.
`user_id` is both the primary key and a cascading foreign key to `profiles.id`.
The API writes the caller identity from the verified JWT; clients cannot select
another owner. RLS permits authenticated users to select, insert, and update only
the row where `auth.uid() = user_id`.

The snapshot contains the bounded values represented by onboarding: baseline
cigarette-use range, trigger identifiers and optional custom trigger, readiness
and quit paths, quit date/check-in preference, selected and top reasons,
bounded synthetic support-person objects, preparation tasks, and treatment or
care-team reminder preferences. PostgreSQL checks constrain every enum, array
size, custom text length, nested support-person shape, and top-reason membership.
The database manages creation and update timestamps.

This table is development-only until privacy, clinical, consent, retention,
deletion, and compliance review is complete. Only synthetic data may be entered
in `breathefree-dev`; real patient or support-person information is prohibited.

## Account-data deletion

Migration source of truth:
`supabase/migrations/202609200001_account_data_deletion.sql`.

The NestJS API first removes the caller's configured avatar using the caller JWT
and Storage RLS, then invokes `delete_my_app_data` with exact confirmation. The
function has a fixed empty search path, rejects unauthenticated calls, and has
execute permission only for `authenticated`. It does not access or delete
`auth.users`; Supabase Auth identity deletion remains a separate privileged
external workflow. API receipts contain only request/completion identifiers and
deleted counts, never profile or quit-plan payloads.
